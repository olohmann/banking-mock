# Banking Assistant - User-Based Account Query Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented userid query based account check functionality in the banking-assistant folder, matching the pattern used in banking-brokerage with the same mocked user IDs.

## New Features Implemented

### 1. User-Based Account Endpoints

#### GET `/api/v1/users/{userId}/accounts`
- Retrieves all accounts for a specific user
- Supports pagination with `limit` and `offset` parameters
- Supports filtering by `status` and `accountType`
- Returns accounts sorted by creation date (newest first)

#### GET `/api/v1/accounts/{accountId}`
- Retrieves detailed information for a specific account
- Returns full account details including user association

### 2. Schema Updates
- Added `userIdSchema` for user ID validation (8-16 alphanumeric characters)
- Added `listAccountsQuerySchema` for query parameter validation
- Added `accountTypeSchema` with banking-specific types: checking, savings, credit, loan
- Added `accountStatusSchema` with statuses: active, inactive, suspended, closed
- Added `bankingAccountSchema` for complete account information
- Added `paginatedAccountsResponseSchema` for paginated responses

### 3. Mock Data Service Enhancements
- Updated mock data to include user associations using the same user IDs as banking-brokerage:
  - `USER1234`: Has checking and savings accounts
  - `USER5678`: Has checking and credit accounts
- Added `getBankingAccountsByUserId()` function with filtering and pagination
- Added `getBankingAccountById()` function
- Added `userExists()` and `getAllUserIds()` utility functions
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing balance/transaction endpoints

### 4. Updated Documentation
- Updated OpenAPI specification with new endpoints
- Added new schema definitions
- Updated health endpoint to include service name
- Added Users tag for organization

## Shared Mock User IDs
Both banking-assistant and banking-brokerage now use the same mock user IDs:
- `USER1234` - Primary test user
- `USER5678` - Secondary test user

## Testing
- Added comprehensive unit tests for all new functionality
- All 35 tests passing
- Tested filtering, pagination, and error handling scenarios
- Verified backward compatibility with existing endpoints

## Example Usage

### Get all accounts for a user:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3002/api/v1/users/USER1234/accounts"
```

### Get checking accounts only:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3002/api/v1/users/USER1234/accounts?accountType=checking"
```

### Get with pagination:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3002/api/v1/users/USER1234/accounts?limit=1&offset=0"
```

### Get specific account details:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3002/api/v1/accounts/ACC1234567890"
